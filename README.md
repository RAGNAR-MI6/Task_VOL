Okay, here is a more detailed README file tailored to your Merchant Onboarding Dashboard project.

# Merchant Onboarding Dashboard

This project is a React application designed as a dashboard for onboarding merchants. It allows an agent (currently hardcoded as agent ID 1027) to fill out a detailed application form for a new merchant and view a list of previously saved applications.

This project was bootstrappled with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **Application Form (`src/component/ApplicationForm.js`)**: A comprehensive form for collecting merchant details, including:
  - Personal & Firm Information (Name, Firm, Business Type, MCC)
  - Contact Information (Contact Person, Mobile)
  - Address Details (Lines 1-3, Locality, City, Pincode)
  - PAN & Bank Details (PAN, PAN DOB, Account Holder Name, Account Type, Account No, IFSC)
  - Other Options (qrBoombox selection)
  - **Input Validation**: Real-time validation and input filtering enforce specific formats (e.g., alphabetic names, numeric Pincode/Mobile/Account No., PAN/IFSC format). Validation logic resides in `src/validation/validation.js`.
  - **Submission**: Submits the form data as a draft to the backend API.
- **Application List (`src/component/ApplicationList.js`)**: Displays a paginated table of applications previously saved by the agent.
  - Fetches data from the backend API.
  - Includes pagination controls (Previous/Next, page count, item range).
  - Refreshes automatically when a new form is successfully submitted.
- **Styling**: Basic styling is provided using CSS modules (`src/App.css`, `src/component/Form.css`, `src/component/Pagination.css`). CSS variables for theming are defined in `src/index.css`.
- **API Interaction**: Uses `axios` for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Proxy Setup**: Configured in `package.json` to proxy API requests from `/api/...` to `http://fintechqrqronboardingbackend-fcwvv1-aa5875-91-108-104-214.traefik.me` during development, avoiding CORS issues.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd onboarding-form
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console. API requests starting with `/api/` will be proxied to the backend specified in `package.json`.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

## Backend API

This frontend application expects a backend API running at the proxied URL (`http://fintechqrqronboardingbackend-fcwvv1-aa5875-91-108-104-214.traefik.me` during development). The following endpoints are currently used:

* **`POST /api/admin/1/saveApplicationDraft`**: Used by `ApplicationForm.js` to submit new application data. Expects the form data in the request body.
* **`GET /api/admin/1/getApplicationByAgentId`**: Used by `ApplicationList.js` to fetch saved applications. Supports `page` and `size` query parameters for pagination.

Ensure the backend server is running and accessible for the application to function correctly.
